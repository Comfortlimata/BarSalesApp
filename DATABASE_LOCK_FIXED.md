# Database Lock Issue - RESOLVED ‚úÖ

## Problem Summary
The Bar Sales App was experiencing "database is locked" errors that prevented:
- Cart-based multi-item sales from working
- Void sales functionality from operating
- Multiple database operations from running concurrently

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was caused by:
1. **Nested Database Connections**: Functions like `create_sale_with_items()` were calling `update_stock()` which created separate database connections within the same transaction
2. **Improper Transaction Handling**: Multiple connections trying to write to the database simultaneously
3. **Missing WAL Mode**: Database wasn't configured for concurrent access
4. **Insufficient Timeouts**: Short connection timeouts causing premature failures

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Database Configuration
- ‚úÖ **Enabled WAL Mode**: `PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL` for better concurrency
- ‚úÖ **Optimized Settings**: Set synchronous=NORMAL, increased cache size, memory temp storage
- ‚úÖ **Increased Timeouts**: 30-second timeouts for critical operations

### 2. Transaction Management
- ‚úÖ **Single Transaction Approach**: All related operations (sales + stock updates) now happen in one transaction
- ‚úÖ **BEGIN IMMEDIATE**: Prevents lock conflicts by acquiring write lock immediately
- ‚úÖ **Proper Rollback**: Comprehensive error handling with transaction rollback

### 3. Connection Handling
- ‚úÖ **Eliminated Nested Connections**: Stock updates now happen within the same connection as sales
- ‚úÖ **Try/Finally Blocks**: Ensures connections are always closed properly
- ‚úÖ **Connection Pooling**: Reduced connection overhead

## Key Changes Made

### Fixed Functions:
1. **`create_sale_with_items()`**:
   - Now uses single transaction for all operations
   - Stock checks and updates within same connection
   - Proper error handling and rollback

2. **`void_sale_transaction()`**:
   - Single transaction for voiding and stock restoration
   - Immediate lock acquisition prevents conflicts

3. **Database Initialization**:
   - WAL mode enabled by default
   - Optimized pragma settings
   - Better timeout handling

## Verification Results

### ‚úÖ All Tests Passing:
